📽️ CineBook CDO – A Java Swing Cinema Ticket Booking System
Project Overview:
You are a first-year computer science student tasked with building a basic but fully functional Java Swing desktop application called CineBook CDO, an online movie ticket booking system for cinemas in Cagayan de Oro (CDO), Philippines.

This version is simplified for learning purposes and does not use a database. Instead, arrays and simple Java collections (like ArrayList) are used to store data in memory.

✅ Functional Requirements:
👤 User Side (Customer):
Basic account simulation (username only, no login system).

Browse movies showing across 3 cinemas.

View schedule and showtimes for each movie.

Select seats (Standard or Deluxe) using a visual-like UI (console/Swing-based).

Add snacks (popcorn, drinks).

Simulate payment options (GCash, PayMaya, Credit Card – just simulate with console messages).

After booking, display a "digital ticket" in a pop-up or message box (with simulated QR code message).

🔐 Admin Side:
Admin login with a hardcoded username/password.

Add/edit movie listings and schedules.

View basic reports: number of tickets sold per movie or cinema.

Manage available seats manually.

Export simulated report to a .txt file (or display in console).

🧱 Technologies & Tools:
Java Swing (GUI)

Java Arrays / ArrayList (for storing movies, seats, and users)

No Database – this is a learning project, data resets each run

JavaMail simulation: Print to console for "email" sending

PDF/CSV Simulation: Export data to .txt files if needed
